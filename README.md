# ü¶à Shark Habitat Modeling & Data Analysis

## ‚ú® Project Overview

This is an **interactive web application** built with **Python** and the **Flask** framework. The project is dedicated to **marine conservation** and **data visualization**, focusing on the **habitat and ecological factors of sharks**.

It serves as a platform to translate complex scientific data and research (such as the included `Research Paper For Sharks.pdf`) into accessible, engaging, and visually compelling web experiences. This makes it a valuable tool for researchers, students, and anyone interested in oceanographic data and ecological sustainability.

2.  **Install Dependencies**
    It's strongly recommended to use a virtual environment for dependency management.

    ```bash
    # Create and activate a virtual environment
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate    # On macOS/Linux
    venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows

    # Install all required libraries from the requirements.txt file
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Run the Application**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    The application will now be running and accessible in your web browser at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
