# 🦈 Shark Habitat Modeling & Data Analysis

## ✨ Quick Project Overview

This is an **interactive web application** built with **Python** and the **Flask** framework. The project is dedicated to **marine conservation** and **data visualization**, focusing on the **habitat and ecological factors of sharks**.

It serves as a platform to translate complex scientific data and research (such as the included `Research Paper For Sharks.pdf`) into accessible, engaging, and visually compelling web experiences. This makes it a valuable tool for researchers, students, and anyone interested in oceanographic data and ecological sustainability.
